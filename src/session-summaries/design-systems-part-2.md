### What a design system is and why you need it.

A design system is a way to organize UI and give a constraint for everyone to follow so that there is consistency in the design. A designer can't design for every possible scenario but have to infer for some situations

Not everybody has a eye for design but there are certain strategies to adopt in creating and implementing a good design. Any project that isn't a "toy project" will need a design system and you must come up with one early enough.
Design systems help in creating modular components which is very important for projects with the intent of serving the general public. 


### Benefits of having a structured design system

* **Consistency**

* **It gives a confidence to your customer that you are selling a trustable product. If things are buggy or not professional enough people tend to lose interest in it.**

* **A good developer experience.** Yeah, to have a good developer experience while building products, it got to have well structured design system. It gives you an insight and expectation as to what you are building.

### Different levels of a design systems.

#### What goes into making your own design systems?

Alot of communication between  the design team, frontend team,product manager, and backend team. You can't decide to do it alone without carrying everyone on the building and management team along. Each have a role to play in the understanding and implementation of the design.

#### Aspects of design systems.

There are basically 2 aspects of design systems. One meant for solely the design team and the other meant for the people implementing the design. The one for the design team contains guides to actualizing the design like grammer, tone, typography, colour pallet, colour combination, visualization and many more.
For the frontend part, there is the individual component, dialogue and lots more.
The language used and the personality of your products is important to scaling your products. You should endeavour to build your product in such a way that it communicate to users in very simple, interactive and understandable terms.

There should be a performance benchmark, that is, the minimum performance level of the product you are building especially when the product is for commercial or public use.

### What are the thing to consider before choosing a design system?

* **Community support.** Community support is important to fixing the issues you will encounter while building your design system and there is no better way to get it fixed than using the community. Therefore, a growing or large community base is important in selecting a design system because you don't want to spend 2 months trying to fix one bug.

* **Customizablity.** Its good practice to check for the availability of your needs in your design system of choice or the availabity of a third party that offers it. Every product has a need and it is your duty to select the design system that best caters for its need.

* **Themeablity.** You'd want to go for design systems that allow you customize things like base-colour, font, colour-fitting and many other need to your desired taste.



### At what point would you roll-out your own design system instead of embracing the existing one?

Basically, when there is no existing one that suits your current need then you may have to roll-out one to fufill your current purpose. 
You must know that the tons of design systems we have today, examples, Material UI, Chakra UI, React-boostrap, styled components e.t.c where all created to meet a need. The deficiency of the earliest ones led to the creation of new ones. So, the best point to roll-out your own design system is when the systems on ground cannot actually give your product the desired feeling and experience.



## Conclusion
Obviously, there are not just a few things but alot of things to consider in selecting, creating and using a design system especially for important products. We hope this session has opened you up to the need for a design system and how to go about it.
