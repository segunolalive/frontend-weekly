# Understanding CSS property (part 1)


In this video, **Valentino Ugbala** practically walk through how CSS positioning manipulates the location of an element base on the position property that is set.
An element that is set to position relative will change its position base on the positioning value, but the initial space is not occupied by another element compared to position absolute that its initial position is occupied by another element.
We will also talk about position fixed that behaves like position absolute but most times cares about the initial block that is established by the viewport.

What you'll learn
- What CSS positioning does
- The values that can be assigned to a position property
- CSS positioning effect on an element and the element around it and lot more

I hope you find it helpful and you enjoy the video
