**Like every technical community, the Frontendweekly team and community is made of a mixture of professionals and volunteers working on every aspect of the mission - mentorship, contributing, teaching and connecting people.**

* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.**: We as a community are working toward supporting people from different backgrounds and identities, so you should be kind to everyone irrespective of differences.

* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We will definitely not agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. Lets endeavour to keep in mind that a community where people feel disrepected, uncomfortable and threatened is not a productive community. Therefore, members of the Frontendweekly community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as other people outside this community

* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** Your work will sometimes be criticized, but we advocate for criticism to be constructive in nature and not destructive or condemning. Accepting constructive criticism gracefully when they come is important for your growth and the community's
